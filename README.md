Snake Game using Python and Turtle graphics.

Concept:

Single-player arcade game

Objective:

Maneuver a growing snake around a confined space to collect food
Avoid hitting the walls or the snake's own body

Gameplay:

- The snake is a line that constantly moves forward.
- Control the direction of the snake's head (up, down, left, right) with arrow keys.
- Eating food makes the snake grow longer, adding difficulty as it becomes harder to avoid collisions.
- The game ends if the snake hits a wall or itself.
